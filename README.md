Instead of manually adjusting all of your settings in the game settings (taking away from our limited play time we have during open beta weekend), I have created this site that allows you to copy all of the settings you have from BF2042 to BF6.
Simply go to https://noahlikes2code.github.io/Battlfield_Settings_Copier/ and follow the on-screen instructions.

Notes - 
-This was done in like 30 minutes.

-You need to have at least opened BF6 to the main menu for the starter setting file to be created.

-The setting files are typically located in your documents folder "...\Documents\Battlefield 6 Open Beta\" & "...\Documents\Battlefield 2042\"

-This only copies the fields over that exist in the BF6 settings file and does not add any fields that didn't already exist. There may be more fields added once we are actually able to get into playing the game and this should accommodate that as well.
